We decided to map energy and transport across connecticut, in the forms of commuter parking, gas stations, EV charging stations, bus stops and railroad stations. Many people need access to these across the state, from commuters, to travelers, and businesses, and by overlaying them this way, it's easy to see the highest concentration of these resources in relation to their location across the state, which can help people trying to plot routes around the state, and businesses looking for areas to expand into that might have a demand for these resources.

Electric charging stations is an especially important point of information for those looking to invest in an electric car or companies trying to be more green. By comparing these to the availability of gas stations we can see points that could use more reliable access to electrical charging, which will be important as electrical cars become cheaper and more common.

Initially we tried to target the business challenge, but we decided this information could also benefit individuals who are looking into travel or trying to decide what areas would be convenient to live in.

We decided to visualize this information with heatmaps because they're a good method of showing relative intensity and concentration of points of interest.
